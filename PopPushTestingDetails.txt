Trying to figure out why the pops and pushes don't match

Steps:
Compile/Run main, save output to text file
use python to CheckPopPush.py
    reports on the total mis-matched
use python to CheckPopPush2.py
    creates a .cpp file that does the same push/pop sequence
        as reported by the main output
Compile/Run this file, save output to the text file
use python to CheckPopPush3.py
    compares the pop and push lines, alerting on a mismatch
